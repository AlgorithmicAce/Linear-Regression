# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is the simplest type of regression. Regression is a method to predict a continous value. In this repository I have included 3 basic linear regression code

1. Basic Linear Regression using Sci-Kit (Data was created randomly)
2. Basic Linear Regression using PyTorch (Data was created randomly)
3. Multiple Linear Regression using Sco-Kit (Data: Graduate Admission)
